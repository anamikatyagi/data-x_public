# INTRODUCTION TO SQL

## Exercises

In this short intro we will play around with some SQL commands. Because there are so many different DBMS that requires installation we will work in an online SQL editor, found here: [https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all)

First we can see that there already exists a database with the tables: Categories, Employees, OrderDetails	, Orders, Products, Shippers, and Suppliers. Feel free to explore these tables, but they are not the ones we will work with (if you want to you can drop them, one by one, by using the SQL command `DROP TABLE [table name];`
